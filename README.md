# asteroid-satellite-astrometry

Database of asteroid satellite astrometry. Current version is primarily based on work presented in the PhD thesis of Kate Minker. If you make use of this astrometry, please cite this thesis and any other work from which the dataset was partially derived, as listed in the folder for each asteroid.

Some work has previously been published in:

I have all of the processed AO images that produced this dataset, but they are far too massive to include in this repository. If you are interested in the reduce images, please contact me.
