# asteroid-satellite-astrometry

Database of asteroid satellite astrometry. Current version is primarily based on work presented in the PhD thesis of Kate Minker. If you make use of this astrometry, please cite this thesis and any other work from which the dataset was partially derived, as listed in the folder for each asteroid.

Some work has previously been published in:

- Minker et al. 2025a : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...698A.136M/abstract
- Minker et al. 2025b : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250713072M/abstract
- Vachier et al. 2022 : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Icar..38215013V/abstract
- Ferrais et al. 2022 : https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...662A..71F/abstract

I have all of the processed AO images that produced this dataset, but they are too heavy to reasonably include in this repository. If you are interested in the reduced images, please contact me.
